## CI/CD pipelines.

This lab is designed to extend the pipeline structures we've built in the previous lab using the GitLab service. The extension will introduce a deployment stage, culminating in a comprehensive CI/CD (Continuous Delivery) process. The pipeline could be easily adapted for any containerized, web-based application.
