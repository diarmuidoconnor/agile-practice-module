## Pods.

In `k8s-basics` create a file named `nginx-pod.yaml`:
~~~
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod1
  labels:
    team: integration
    app: todo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
~~~
The manifest declares a single-container pod that uses the NGINX web server. Ccreate the pod resource in the cluster:
~~~
$ oc apply -f nginx-pod.yaml 
~~~
Check the result:
~~~
$ oc get pods -o wide            
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE      NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod1   1/1     Running   0          3m29s   10.129.2.57   worker2   <none>           <none>
~~~
Use port-forwarding to enable a web client communicate with the web server:
~~~
$ oc port-forward nginx-pod1  3005:80                 
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3005 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:3005 -> 80
~~~
Open a browser tab at http://localhost:3006/


In VS Code, open a second integrated terminal and check the log output from the pod container:
~~~
‚ùØ oc logs nginx-pod1 
~~~
The last entry in the response should confirm the request from the browser, i.e. GET / HTTP/1.1.

We can open a terminal session inside the contaiiner:
~~~
$ oc exec -it nginx-pod1  -- /bin/sh
~~~
At the container prompt, type the following command sequence:
~~~
ls
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
ls
cat index.html     
echo "<b>I added a new line ....</b>" >> index.html 
~~~
We added a new line to the end of the default NGINX home page. Assuming the the port-forwarding to the container is still active, refresh the browser to confirm the page change. Create a new f

Commit the work so far:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Creating simple single-container pod."

### ReplicaSets.
Creating multiple copies of a pod, termed replicasets, distributed across the worker nodes of a cluster inproves app availability.
