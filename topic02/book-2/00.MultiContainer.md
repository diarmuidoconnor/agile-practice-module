## Multi-component Application.

#### Please note thst you must submit this lab work to Moodle for assessment. See final section for instructions. You must type the exact Git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment.


Recall, we demonstrated a mukti-container application during the Docker part of this module. That application's architecture is illustrated below for your convenience - see [here][lab] for the Docker lab you completed previously.

![][docker]

We will deploy this application to Kubernetes as a set of deployments and services. Both applicatio components (the Mongo database server and the Express Web App) will be deployed as pods using deployment manifests, and each will have a matching service.

In a VS Code terminal, log in to the OCP cluster:
~~~
$  oc login https://api.ocp-setu.waltoninstitute.ie:6443 --username=your_username      (Substitute your username)
~~~

## Setup.

A pod needs privileges to allow it to pull images from Docker Hub, for example, MongoDB. In Kubernetes, a pod's privileges are determined by the __ServiceAccount__ assigned to it. A ServiceAccount has policies attached to it, which grant privileges to the pod. Your account on the cluster has a number of service accounts attached to allow you create resources (pods, services, etc). Check this with:
~~~
 $ oc get sa        (sa = serviceaccount)
~~~
The important one is `bsc-ssd-y4-2025-sa`, which was created specifically for this module.

Create a new folder (anywher) called `multi-component-app` and import it into VS Code. Add a `.gitignore` file:
~~~
*.log
~~~
Create a local Git repository in the folder, and make the initial commit to the repo.
