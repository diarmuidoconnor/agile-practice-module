### Externalise Configuration.


### Cleanup.

Delete the MongoDB deployment:
~~~bash
$ oc delete deploy mongo-depl
~~~

### ConfigMap resource. 

The MongoDB deployment manifest has its configuration data hard-coded. A better approach is to externalise this using a ConfigMap resource. Create a new file `mongo-config.yaml` and add the following:
~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: 
    name: mongodb-config
immutable: false
data:
    username: admin
    password: secret
    sample.conf: |
 This is a test file
 with multiple lines
~~~
The last data item (sample.conf) is a demonstraation of a configuration file to be used by a container image.

Create the resource:
~~~bash
$ oc apply -f  mongo-config.yaml
$ oc get cm                   (cm = ConfigMap)
$ oc describe cm mongodb-config                      
~~~

Update `mongo-deployment.yaml`by replacing the hardcoded data with references to the data in the ConfigMAP as shown below:
~~~yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongo-depl
spec:
    . . . as before . . . 
    template:
         . . . as before . . .    
        spec:
             serviceAccountName: bsc-ssd-y4-2025-sa
             containers:
             - image: bitnami/mongodb:latest
                 name: mongo
                 env:
                 - name: MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD
                    valueFrom:
                        configMapKeyRef:
                            key: password
                            name: mongodb-config  
                 - name: MONGODB_ROOT_USER
                    valueFrom:
                         configMapKeyRef:
                            key: username
                            name: mongodb-config
                ports:
                - containerPort: 27017
                volumeMounts:
                - name: mongo-volume
                   mountPath: /bitnami/mongodb  # /data/db
                - name: mongo-config-test
                   mountPath: /bitnami

      volumes:
      - name: mongo-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: my-mongo-pvc
      - name: mongo-config-test
         configMap:
            name: mongodb-config
                items:
                - key: sample.conf
                   path: test.conf
~~~
Note that the `sample.config` configuration item is mounted at `/bitnami/test.config` in the pod container

Create the deployment resource:
~~~bash
$ oc apply -f  mongo-deployment.yaml
$ oc get po
~~~
Check the pod container has the correct configuration:
~~~bash
 $ oc exec -it mongo-depl-57ffbd4cd7-kzdrb -- sh      
sh-5.2$ env                                                                                                        
. . . . . other environment variables , , , , 
MONGODB_ROOT_USER=admin
. . . . . other environment variables , , , , 
MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret
. . . . . other environment variables , , , ,  
sh-5.2$ cat /bitnami/test.conf                                                                                     
This is a test file
with multiple lines
sh-5.2$ exit
~~~

In `mongo-config.yaml`:
+ Change the password to `private`.
+ Change sample.cpnfog by add a new line with some text.

Update the resource:
~~~bash
$ oc apply -f  mongo-config.yaml                    
~~~

Delete the MongoDB pod:
~~~bash
$ oc delete pod/mongo-demo-depl-69945f848c-k82z8       (Use your pod name)
~~~
Kubernetes recreates the pod. Start an interactive terminal session  (oc exec -it .....) and check the configuration updates are applied.

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Creating  ConfigMap resource for database server."
~~~

### Secret resource. 

The database password should be stored in a Secret resource rather than in a ConfigMap. Create the file `mongo-secret.yaml`:
~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata: 
    name: mongodb-secret
immutable: false
type: Opaque
data:
    password: TODO
~~~
The data in a Secret resource must be Base64 encoded. Suppose we want the password to be 'password1234'; the encoded value is:
~~~bash
$  echo -n password1234 | base64          
cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM0
~~~
In `mongo-secret.yaml`, change the password value:
~~~
     password: cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM0
~~~
Create the secret resource:
~~~bash
$ oc apply -f  mongo-secret.yaml
$ oc get  secret
$ oc describe  secret mongodb-secret                  
~~~

Update `mongo-deployment.yaml`by replacing the ConfigMap value for the password with the secret as shown below:
~~~yaml
 . . . . . as before
        spec:
             serviceAccountName: bsc-ssd-y4-2025-sa
             containers:
             - image: bitnami/mongodb:latest
                 name: mongo
                 env:
                 - name: MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD
                    valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                            key: password
                            name: mongodb-secret  
                 - name: MONGODB_ROOT_USER
                    valueFrom:
                         configMapKeyRef:
                            key: username
                            name: mongodb-config
    . . . . . . . as before . . . . . . .
~~~
This time we must update the deployment:
~~~bash
$ oc apply -f  mongo-deployment.yaml
~~~
Start an interactive terminal session with the MongoDB pod and check the environment variables, as before.

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Creating  Secret resource for database server."
~~~
