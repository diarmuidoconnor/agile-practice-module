## Exercises,

### Exercise 1,

Make the following changes to the above application stack:
1.  Change the MongoDB server service's name from mongodb to __database__.
1.  Change the top-level networks section to the following:
~~~yaml
   db-network:
       external: false  # Create a new network 
       name: 'mongodb-network'
~~~
1. __You are required to__ make the necessary change(s) so the web app can be accessed at the address http://localhost:5000/ instead of http://localhost:3000/.


Now try to start the set of services using docker-compose as before. It will fail because some of our changes affect other settings in the YANL file. __You are required__ to complete the necessary modifications in the YAML file and ensure the web app is accessible from the browser.


Commit the changes following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Configuration changs - service names, networking."
$ git push origin master
~~~

### Exercise 2,

Delete any running containers. Type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker volume prune     # Delete any unused volumes
~~~

__You are required to__ make the necessary to the Compose file so that the Mongo Database is using a named volume to persist its data. The volume should be created by Compose when the stack is created for the first time. Bame the volume 'profiledata'.


Commit the changes following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Changed data persistence to named volume."
$ git push origin master
~~~
