## Docker Compose.

To date, we have started a multi-container application by typing a series of (sometimes) multi-line commands at the command prompt. This manual approach is tedious and error-prone. The Docker Compose tool allows us to __automate__ this task. In this lab, we will demonstrate the tool on the User Profile web app. 

### Git setup.
It's a good idea to back up your code projects to GitHub. Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository called `docker-profile-app`. In VS Code, type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin your_repos_URL
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Dockerized app."
$ git push origin master
~~~
