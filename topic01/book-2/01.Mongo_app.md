## Demo 1 Setup.

From the command line, type the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker pull mongo:8.0-rc.       (An image containing the MongoDB database server)
$ docker pull mongo-express:1.0-20-alpine3.19.       (An image containing a web-based MongoDB admin application)
$ docker network create mongo-network
~~~
The last command creates a virtual network (The new network's name is arbitrary). To confirm the creation, type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker network ls
~~~
As well as our new network, Docker creates some default networks at start-up, e.g. bridge and host. Docker networks have a driver (or type), the default is the bridge type. Other types include overlay, host, macvlan, etc. Every container is automatically attached to a network, which is the bridge network by default. Each bridge network is assigned a IP address subnet range and a gateway to the internet. Each container added to a bridge network is assigned an IP address from the subnet range - this is performed by a DHCP server available to Docker. Type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker network inspect mongo-network
~~~
Notice the config section of the JSON response:
~~~json
    "Config": [
        {
            "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
            "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
        }
    ]
~~~
Use the same command for the default bridge network interface.

Start a container for the MongoDB image:
~~~bash
$ docker run -d --net mongo-network \
    --name mongoDB  \
    -p 27017:27017 \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
 mongo:8.0-rc
~~~
Points to note:
1. We can control the initialization of a container's environment variables using the -e option, as illustrated above. The variable names depend on the imagre's requirements, and these are documented on Docker Hub for public images. For example, go to [this page][mongov] and scroll to the Environment Variables section for details on the MongoDB image. Some image's environment variables are optional and have default values.
1. We are attaching our MongoDB container to the mongo-network virtual network. Docker creates a virtual ethernet interface for the container and links it to the bridge/switch. Only containers attached to the  mongo-network network can communicate with this database container.
1. Port 27017 is the default MongoDB port for client communication. Using Docker's port forwarding facility, we are mapping the container's port 27017 to the host computer's port 27017. This will allow non-containerized applications to interact with the database - see later.

Type the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker run -d --network mongo-network \
      --name mongo-express  \
      -p 8081:8081 \
      -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin \
      -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=secret \
      -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb   \
    mongo-express:1.0-20-alpine3.19
~~~
Points to note:

1. We are using the same virtual network for both containers because the mongo-express web app needs to connect to the Mongo database.
1. The ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER environment variable must be set to the __name of the container__ hosting our database server, i.e. mongoDB. Custom bridge networks (e.g. mongo-network) support DNS name resolution; this allows containers inside the sa,e network to use container names instead of IP address to communicate. 
1. The ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME and ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD must match the credentials used by the MongoDB container. 
1. The mongo-express web application is listening for HTTP requests on port 8081. Mapping this container port to the equivilant one on the host computer will allow a web browser client access the app.

To access the Mong-Express admin web application hosted by the second container, open a new browser tab at http://localhost:8081/. Login with the credentials *admin* for username and *pass* for password. The browser lists the databases managed by the MongoDB server running inside the first container. 

We must add a new database to the server using the web admin tool. In the browser, locate the text box at the top-right, enter the name `user-account` and click the Create Database button. 

------------------------------------

Before continuing with multi-container applications, lets look at some basic Docker networking. We will cover the topic in more detail in a later lab.

Concerning the status of the mongo-network network, type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker network inspect mongo-network
~~~
Notice the containers section of the JSON response:
~~~json
       "Containers": {
            "4421b2d2f2f1ae8f7bbad777f308a5c2b718a59db06531488d567083004a5ea5": {

                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:03",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.3/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            },
            "5010babf9a8dbdc28592a16e270acd6858347ce9f096009b5a30edae87bbc8a4": {
                "Name": "mongoDB",

                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
~~~
It shows the IP address assigned to each container by the DHCP server. The MacAddress property corresponds to the virtual ethernet interface assigned to a container. Confirm the IP addresses with the command:
~~~bash
$ docker inspect mongoDB
~~~

More on Docker networking in a later lab.

### Simple Web App.

Clone this repository:
~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/simple-profile-app
~~~
This application is a simple server-side rendering web app for updating the user-account database managed by our MongoDB server. It is not dockerized for now; we will do that in a later lab. Import the project into VS Code and create a file in the `app` folder called `.env` with the following content:
~~~
MONGO_USER='admin' 
MONGO_PASS='secret' 
MONGO_HOST='localhost'
MONGO_PORT=27017 
APP_HOST='localhost'
PORT=3000
~~~
Open an integrated terminal and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ npm  install
$ cd app
$ node server.js
~~~
Open a new web browser tab at http://localhost:3000/. Click the Add/Edit Profile button. In the web form, enter your name, email address, and list of interests, and then click the Update Profile button. This sequence should result in the web app __writing a record to a table named users in our user-account database__. We can use the Mongo Express application to confirm this. Switch to the browser tab that shows the Mongo Express application, click the View button beside the `user-account` database, and click the View button beside the `users` collection name (A collection in Mongo is similar to a table in relational database). The page shows the details of the user profile you entered on the web form. 

There are two communication flows working in this setup:

1. Simple Web app to MongoDB container - This is over the regular localhost network managed by the host computer itself. The app communicates with the MongoDB server using the host's port 27017, which is mapped back to the MongoDB container's port 27017. 
1. Mongo Express container to MongoDB container - This is via the Docker-managed network we created - the bridge network named mongo-network.

In future labs, we will return to this web app to demonstrate other aspects of the Docker platform and other topics on this module. For convenience, we will refer to it as the __User Profile Web App__.
