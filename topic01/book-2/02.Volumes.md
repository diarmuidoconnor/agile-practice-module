## Volumes.

The weakness in our multi-container app is that there is no persistence of MongoDB's data; if the container dies and we restart it, the data is lost. We can solve this with __volumes__.

### Reset.

Delete the Mongo container:
~~~
$ docker stop my-mongo
$ docker rm my-mongo
~~~
The Express container can remain running, even though it cannot connect to the database temporarily.

### Bind mounts,

On your laptop, create a folder (anywhere) called `my-db`. Start a new container for the database server, but this time bind-mount the folder to the container path `/data/db` (Mongo's default databases pathname):
~~~
$ docker run -d --net mongo-network \
    --name my-mongoDB  \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
    -v relative-path-to/my-db/:/data/db \
mongo:8.0-rc
~~~
Replace elative-path-to/my-db/ with what's appropriate for your case, e.g. ./my-db/
