## Multi-Container applications.

In this lab, we will assemble a multi-container applications. Docker uses virtual networks to facilitate communication between containers. Containers reference each other using IP addresses (default) or by container names. We will manually set up the application's architecture, but this can be automated. The architecture of the app being used is illustrated below:

![][arch]

The architectures is comprised of:

1. A desktop app/tool.
1. A database server.
1. A web-based database administration tool.

Only components two and three above are containerized; component one will run outside the Docker framework, as a desktop app.
