## Multi-Container applications.

In this lab, we will assemble multi-container applications. Docker uses virtual networks to facilitate communication between containers. Containers reference each other using IP addresses (default) or by container names. We will manually set up the application's architecture, but this can be automated. Two sample application will be used as case studies, both with similar architecture but different technology stacks.

The architectures are comprised of:

1. A Node/Express frontend app.
1. A database server.
1. A web-based database administration tool.


Only components two and three above are containerized; component one will run outside the Docker framework for now but we will containerize it in a later lab.

For the sake of varitey, one of the case study applications uses a MongoDB database server, while the other uses Postgres for its database.
