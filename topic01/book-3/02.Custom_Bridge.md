## Custom Bridge Network

We can create additional bridge networks besides the default one provided by Docker. This capability allows us to isolate applications and services further for improved security. Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker network create mybridge
$ docker network ls
$ docker network inspect mybridge
$ docker network inspect bridge
~~~
By studying the two network inspect command responses above, we note the new mybridge network has a different gateway and IP subnet range; this confirms it is a separate, isolated network. Docker created a separate virtual network interface for mybridge. Add some containers to the custom bridge:
~~~bash
$ docker run -it -d --rm --network mybridge --name  box3 busybox
$ docker run -it -d --rm --network mybridge --name  box4 busybox
$ docker network inspect mybridge
~~~
We use the --network option to specify the network to which we want the containers added. The inspect command above will confirm the two containers are assigned IP addresses in the mybridge subnet range.

Start a terminal session for the box3 container and explore its network:
~~~bash
$ docker exec -it box3 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping box4         (DNS name resolution works!)
PING box4 (172.19.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.141 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.151 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.249 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.147 ms
^C
--- box4 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.141/0.172/0.249 ms
/ # ping 172.17.0.2.      (Use your box1 IP address)
PING 172.17.0.2 (172.17.0.2): 56 data bytes
^C
--- 172.17.0.2 ping statistics ---
42 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
/ # 
/ # exit
~~~
The first ping command above shows that a custom bridge network __does support DNS name resolution__, i.e. we can reference a container by its name as well as its IP address. Recall that the default bridge does not provide DNS name resolution. The second ping command above confirms the two bridge networks are isolated as we cannot reach box1 (on the default network) from inside the mybridge network, and visa versa.

### Clean up.

Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop box1
$ docker stop box3
$ docker stop box4
~~~

### Exercise 1.

Setup the necessary containers in the mybridge network so that one container can send a curl request to an nginx web server as illustrated below:
~~~
/ # 
/ # curl http://webserver:80
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
/ # exit
~~~ 

### Exercise 2.

Using the busybox image, create three containers, named boxA, boxB, and boxC, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. boxA can communicate with boxC, but not boxB.
1. boxB can communicate with boxC, but not boxA
1. boxC can communicate with boxA and boxB

Create additional networks if necessary.

[Hint: A container can be part of multiple bridge networks simultaneously. Simply repeat the --network option in the run command.
~~~bash
 $ docker run -d -it --rm --rm --name boxX --network=net1  --network=net2  busybox
~~~
