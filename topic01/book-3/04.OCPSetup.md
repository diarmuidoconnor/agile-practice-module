## OCP/Kubernetes Setup..

The Red Hat OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform (OCP) is an enterprise-standard Kubernetes platform. The [Walton Institute][walton] has provisioned a Kubernetes cluster on an OCP installation for use by SETU Waterford students. Most of the configuration, deployment & management work for the containers deployed to OCP will be via the command line (CLI). To install it, go to the [cluster dashboard][dash] and log in with the credentials already provided - it's safe to skip any security warnings you may receive in the response. In the OCP dashboard, expand the left panel, select Virtualisation => Overview, and click on the "Download the virtctl command-line utility" link (top right). Download the __oc - OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)__ tool for your platform and add it to the PATH environment variable, and test that the binaries can be seen:
~~~bash
$ oc version
~~~

The CLI is now ready for use. The user must first log in to the cluster before being able to administer any of the features. 
~~~
$ oc login https://api.ocp-setu.waltoninstitute.ie:6443 --username=<yourUserName>
~~~
Verify you are logged into the cluster:
~~~bash
$ oc whoami
~~~
