## Docker Registry.

We can push images to a registry to facilitate the sharing and have a backup copy in case of local host corruption. Many options are available, including Docker Hub (default), AWS ECR, GitLab, GitHub, etc. We will demonstrate DockerHub here. In a browser tab, go to https://hub.docker.com/ and sign in to your account. We will return to this page shortly.

Type the following commands (replace doconnor with your Docker Hub username):
~~~bash
$ docker login (Login to Docker Hub)
$ docker tag dice:1.0 doconnor/dice:1.0
$ docker images
   . . . . . . .
   doconnor/dice    1.0                 3e561f20f452   21 hours ago   1.02GB
   dice             1.0                 3e561f20f452   21 hours ago   1.02GB
   . . . . . . . . 
$ docker push doconnor/dice:1.0
~~~
Return to the browser tab and refresh the page. You should now see a repository for the dice image.  On the command line, type the commands (replace doconnor with your Docker Hub username):
~~~bash 
$ docker rmi doconnor/dice:1.0. (Remove an image locally)
$ docker images
$ docker pull  doconnor/dice:1.0. (Download an image from Docker Hub)
 [Note: anyone can download your image as it is public.]
$ docker images
~~~
Import the Dice game into VS Code. Open the file `script.py` and change line 10 to the following:
~~~py
 username = input('\nPlease Enter your pseudonym: ' ) 
~~~
Save the change and type the commands:
~~~bash
$  docker build -t doconnor/dice:1.1 (Note the updated tag number - 1.1)
$ docker images
$ docker push  doconnor/dice:1.1    
~~~
In Docker Hub, the repository now has two versions of the image. Download this version of the image (docker pull). Multiple versions of an image can reside locally. Also, various containers running different versions of an image can coexist.
