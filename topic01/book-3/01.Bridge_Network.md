##  Default bridge networks.
From the terminal prompt, type the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker network ls
~~~

Docker creates several virtual networks when launched, i.e. bridge, host, and none. Each network has a driver or type, e.g. bridge, overlay, host, macvlan, etc. We can create custom networks for better container isolation - see later. Docker instantiates a virtual network interface for each bridge (type) network it manages. The properties of the default bridge network (or any Docker virtual network) can be displayed with inthe command:
~~~bash
$ docker network inspect bridge
~~~
Notice in the response that Docker's DHCP server assigned an IP range to the subnet. 

Create some containers:
~~~bash
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name box1 busybox
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name box2 busybox
~~~
[ "The BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousinsimage " - [read more][busybox] ]
Inspect the bridge network again:
~~~bash
$ docker network inspect bridge
~~~
A sample response excerpt is as follows:

 },

The two new containers were added to the default bridge network. Each container was assigned an IP address within bridge's subnet range.  We can use the inspect command with containers as well:
~~~bash
$ docker inspect box1
~~~
A sample response excerpt is as follows:
~~~json

                "bridge": {
                    "IPAMConfig": null,

                }
      }
~~~
Containers within a subnet can communicate with each other. Try the following sequence:
~~~bash
 $ docker exec -it box1 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping 172.17.0.3     (Use your box2 IP address)      
PING 172.17.0.3 (172.17.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.17.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.098 ms
64 bytes from 172.17.0.3: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.148 ms
64 bytes from 172.17.0.3: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.135 ms
^C
--- 172.17.0.3 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.098/0.127/0.148 ms
/ # ping google.com.      (Try reaching the internet)
PING google.com (209.85.203.138): 56 data bytes

/ # 
/ # exit
$
~~~
The sequence shows that containers within the default bridge network space can reach one another and access the internet.

#### DNS name resolution.
In networking, DNS name resolution is a feature for translating a node's domain name to its IP address. Try this sequence:
~~~bash
$ docker exec -it box1 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping box2
ping: bad address 'box2'
/ # exit
$
~~~
This sequence shows that the default bridge network does __not provide DNS name resolution__. This is a weakness, but a solution is available - see later.

#### Port Forwarding.
Add a web server container to the default bridge network: 
~~~bash
$ docker run -d --rm --name webserver nginx
$ docker inspect webserver
~~~
[The --rm option means the container will be deleted when it is stopped.]

The response to the inspect command above will include the IP address assigned to the webserver container, e.g.
~~~json
  "Networks": {
        "bridge": {
            "IPAMConfig": null,
            "Links": null,
            "Aliases": null,
            "NetworkID": "567fe1dec3d36309b79470ad33269271e650a88a53557d9ca17a7464a9af81ea",
            "EndpointID": "ff888e96ea0e03234a6d57add3d78b726cb2e991343ce371c19b31f1fc071ecb",
            "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.4",
            "IPPrefixLen": 16,
            "IPv6Gateway": "",
            "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
            "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
            "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:04",
            "DriverOpts": null
     }
 }
~~~
Suppose we want to send an HTTP request to the web server from another container in the network using the curl utility. Perform the following sequence:
~~~bash
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name client alpine
$ docker exec -it client /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # apk --version     (apk is a Linux packet manager)
apk-tools 2.14.4, compiled for x86_64.
/ # apk --update add curl
..... installs curl utility in the container ....
/ # curl http://172.17.0.3:80     (Use your nginx server's IP address)

[Note: The alpine image is very similar to busybox, except it also has a package manager, i.e. apk utility.]

The curl command above received the web home page of the web server, as expected. Try accessing the same page from a web browser - http://172.17.0.3:80/. This fails because the IP address is local to the bridge network. Try http://localhost:80/. This fails because the host is not running the web server. The only way to access the web server from the host is to bind the container's port 80 to a port on the host - any available port. This is termed port forwarding or port publishing. Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop webserver
$ docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name webserver nginx
~~~
In the browser, try http://localhost:3000/. Now it works. The run command maps/binds the container's port 80 to the host's port 3000. The NGINX server is listening on port 80. 

### Clean up.

Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop webserver
$ docker stop box2
$ docker stop client
~~~
Leave the box1 container running for the next section.
