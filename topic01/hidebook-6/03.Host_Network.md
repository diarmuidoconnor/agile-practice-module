## Host Network

Docker creates several default networks at start-up; we have already seen the default bridge. Another one is called host, and its driver/type is host:
~~~bash
$ docker network ls
~~~
A container added to the host network gets the same IP address as the host computer itself. These containers effectively add a service to the host computer. We do not need port forwarding in these cases. The port used by the application is automatically bound to the corresponding host's port. For example:
~~~bash
$  docker run -d --rm --network host --name webserver2  nginx    (-p option not used)
~~~
We can now navigate to the NGINX server home page using the URL: http://HOST_IP_ADDRESS:80/. However, this only works when running Docker on Linux in a Virtualized environment that we can access directly. In this scenario, the Docker host IP is the IP dynamically assigned to the Linux instance instead of the IP of the Virtual Machine host. While Docker Desktop uses virtualization internally (in particular, Linux on top of VirtualBox), we do not have an IP address for the Virtual Machine; we only have an IP for the Docker Desktop host, i.e. your Mac/Windows laptop. 

In a later lab, we will be able to demonstrate the Docker host network by running Docker in an Amazon EC2 instance, which is a Linux OS running on top of a Hypervisor virtualization.
