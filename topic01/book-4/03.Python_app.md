## Run Anywhere.

To date, all our sample applications are based on the Node/JS platform, which is installed on our host computer for use in other modules (e.g. Web App Dev 2). However, a major benefit of Docker is that any 3rd party dependencies of an application, such as Node/JS, do not need to be installed on the host computer; they are packaged within the Docker image instead. This is the __Build Once, Run Anywhere__ goal of containerization. To prove this, suppose we want to run a Python application without installing the language's CLI tools locally. Clone this repository:
~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/docker-python-dice
~~~
It's a Python console-based application for playing a simple dice-rolling game. Import it into VS Code and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ docker build -t dice:1.0 .
$ docker run  -it --name dice dice:1.0
~~~ 
You can now play a game written in Python on your host computer without installing the language's CLI.

### Exercise 4.

Push this image to your Docker Hub account.
