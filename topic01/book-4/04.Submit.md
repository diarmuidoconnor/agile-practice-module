## Submit Instructions.

For this lab, you should submit to Moodle a simple  text file called `docker.txt` containing :

Your Docker Hub __username__, e.g. doconnor. 
The URL of your GitHub repository for the profile app.

That's just two lines of text in the file. The file should be `.txt`, not pdf, doc, or any other format.

The submission link on Moodle is [here][submit].
