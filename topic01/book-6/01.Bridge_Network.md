## The Default network (bridge)

From the terminal prompt, type the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker network ls
~~~
The bridge network corresponds to a virtual network interface created by Docker when it was launched on the current host. The properties of this network can be displayed with the command:
~~~bash
$ docker inspect network bridge
~~~
Notice in the response that Docker's DHCP server assigned an IP range to the subnet associated with this virtual interface. Create some containers:
~~~bash
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name box1 busybox
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name box1 busybox
~~~
Inspect the bridge network again and notice that Docker added the two new containers to it and assigned IP addresses within its subnet range 
~~~bash
$ docker inspect network bridge
~~~
Sample response:

Containers within a subnet can communicate with each other. Try the following sequence:
~~~bash
 $ docker exec -it box1 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping 172.17.0.3.         (pinging box2 via its IP address)

~~~
The sequence shows that containers within the bridge network space can reach one another and access the internet. Try this sequence:
~~~bash
$ docker exec -it box1 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping box2
ping: bad address 'box2'
/ # exit
$
~~~
This sequence shows that the default bridge network does not support DNS name resolution. Add a web server container to the default bridge network: 
~~~bash
 $ docker run -d --rm --name webserver nginx
$ docker ps
$ docker inspect webserver
~~~
The response to the inspect command above will include the IP address assigned to the webserver container, e.g.
~~~json

                }
            }
~~~
Try accessing the web server from a browser: http://172.17.0.4/  (Use your IP address). It fails because the IP address is only meaningful within the bridge subnet. The only way to access this server is by using __port forwarding__. Type these commands:
~~~bash
$  docker stop webserver   
$ docker ps
$ docker run -d --rm -p 3000:80 --name webserver nginx
$ docker ps
~~~
The run command maps the container's port 80 to the host's port 3000. Since the NGINX server is listening on port 80, we can access the server from a browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ - try it. 

### Clean up.

Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop webserver
$ docker stop box2
~~~
