## Custom Bridge Network

We can create additional bridge networks besides the default one provided by Docker at start-up. This capability allows us to isolate applications and services further for improved security.   Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker network create mybridge
$ docker network ls
$ docker inspect network mybridge
$ docker inspect network bridge
~~~
By studying the two network inspect command responses above, we note the new mybridge network has a different gateway and IP subnet range; this confirms it is a separate, isolated network. Add some containers to the custom bridge:
~~~bash
$ docker run -it -d --rm --network mybridge --name  box3 busybox
$ docker run -it -d --rm --network mybridge --name  box4 busybox
$ docker inspect network mybridge
~~~
We must specify the network to which we want the containers added using the --network option. The inspect command above will confirm the two containers are assigned IP addresses in the mybridge subnet range.

Create a terminal session inside the box3 container and explore the network:
~~~bash
$ docker exec -it box3 /bin/sh
/ # 
/ # ping box4         (DNS name resolution)

The first ping command shows that a custom bridge network supports DNS name resolution, i.e. we can reference a container by its name rather than IP address. Recall, the default bridge does not provide DNS name resolution. The second ping command confirms the two bridge networks are isolated as we cannot reach box1 (on the default network) from inside the mybridge network, and visa versa.
