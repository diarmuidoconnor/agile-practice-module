## Exercises,

### Exercise 1,

Change the MongoDB server service's name from mongodb to __database__.

Now try to start the set of services using docker-compose as before. It will fail because our change affects other settings in the YANL file. __You are required__ to complete the necessary modifications in the YAML file and ensure the web app is accessible from the browser.

Commit the changes following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Configuration changs - service name change."
$ git push origin master
~~~

### Exercise 2,

Delete any running containers. Type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker volume prune     # Delete any unused volumes
~~~

__You are required to__ make the necessary changes to the Compose file so that the Mongo Database is using a named volume to persist its data. The volume should be created by Compose when the stack is created for the first time. Name the volume 'profiledata'.


Commit the changes following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Changed data persistence to named volume."
$ git push origin master
~~~
