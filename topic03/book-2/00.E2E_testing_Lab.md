# E2E testing - Cypress.

This lab will use the Cypress testing framework to automate the End-to-End (E2E) testing of the Movies Man app from the Web App Development 2 module.

## Setup.

Download [this archive][start], unzip it, import it into VS Code, install the app's dependencies, and add Cypress to the project (Note, this is a large download):
~~~bash
$ npm install
$ npm install --save-dev cypress 
~~~
Create the `.env` file and add the TMDB key:
~~~
VITE_TMDB_KEY=... your key ...
~~~

To prove it worked, type:
~~~
$ npx cypress open         
~~~
Note, the command is npx, not npm; npx is a utility for running binary executables, which are included in some npm packages, e.g. cypress, mocha.

The above command starts the Cypress GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool. On the GUI, select E2E Testing, click Continue, and click Start E2E testing in Chrome. THis sequence starts a new instance of the Chrome browser:

Click Create New spec. Set the spec name to `cypress/e2e/dummy.cy.js`, click Create spec, and click Run the spec. It creates a sample test spec file and executed it. You should now see the following

This procedure caused Cypress to create a number of new folders and files in the project, as illustrated below:

Cypress' configuration file is `cypress.config.js`. Add an entry to it for the URL of the target application - the Movies app:
~~~js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",   // NEW
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
    },
  },
});
~~~
We store any sensitive data associated with tests in a file in the project's base folder called `cypress.env.json`. Add your TMDB API key to it, as follows:

~~~js
{
    "TMDB_KEY": ". . . your API key here . . . "
}
~~~
In the `.gitignore` file, add a reference to the configuration file to block it from inclusion in the Git repo:

~~~
cypress.env.json
~~~ 
That completes the setup. Shut down the Cypress GUI application.
