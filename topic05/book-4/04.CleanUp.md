## Clean Up.

To ensure you minimize the cost you incur for launching an EC2 instance, we must stop the VM. We will not terminate it as this would require us to set it up all over again when we need it later. To stop the instance, in the browser, go to the AWS Management Console, naviate to the EC2 service page and do the following:

+ in the left panel, select Instances, under the Instances section.
+ Click the DockerHost instance in the list.
+ Click the Instance State dropdown menu (top of the page) and choose the Stop Instance option.
+ Wait to ensure the instance is fully stopped.
