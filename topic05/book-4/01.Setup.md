## Setup.

### GitLab repository.

In a browser tab, log in to your Gitlab account and create a new repository named `docker-2048-game`. Ensure the repo is Public and the namespace is set to your username, as before.

Clone this repository to your local computer:
~~~bash
$ git clone [the URL of the new Gitlab repository]
~~~

For the sake of variety, we will use a different application as the context for this lab. Download [this archive][start], unzip it, and copy all its files into the `docker-2048-game` - ensure the `.gitignore` is included in the copy. Commit:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure"
~~~

The application is a web-based implementation of the [2048 Number Puzzle Game][game]. Import the `docker-2048-game` project into VS Code and type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker build -t  2048game:1.0  .
$ docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name 2048game  2048game:1.0
~~~
Notice in the project's Dockerfile that the game's image is based on the NGINX web server image, and all the project's files are copied to the web server's base directory (/usr/share/nginx/html).
  
In a browser tab, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game.

### Docker Hub repository.

Push this image to your Docker Hub account as follows:
~~~bash
$ docker login 
$ docker tag  2048game:1.0  [your-hub-username]/2048game:1.0
$ docker push  [your-hub-username]/2048game:1.0
~~~
Check the new repository in your Docker Hub account.
