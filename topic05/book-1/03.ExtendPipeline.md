##  Extend the CI pipeline.

We want to add a job to the pipeline's test stage that checks the basic working state of the profile-app image, such that when it receives an HTTP request on port 3000, the response should be the web app's home page. Additionally, a successful response also means the app has connected to the Mongo database, as this is part of its start-up procedure. 

In `.gitlab-ci.yml`, replace the base-test job with the following:
~~~yaml
base-test:
  stage: test
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services: 
     - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20
  before_script:
    - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
    - docker pull  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}  
    - docker pull  mongo:8.0-rc 
    - docker network create mongo-network
  script: 
    - docker run -d --net mongo-network --name mongoDB -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret  mongo:8.0-rc 
    - docker run -d --network mongo-network --name ${APP_NAME} -p 3000:3000 -e MONGO_PASS=secret -e MONGO_HOST=mongoDB ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
    - docker ps                   # For debugging purposes
    - docker logs ${APP_NAME}     # For debugging purposes
    - apk add curl
    - curl http://docker:3000 | grep 'User profile'  # Simple test
~~~
We use the before-script block in the above job for code clarity only, i.e. the separation of concerns coding principle; it would still work if all the commands were placed in the (build) script block. The job's base image (docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20) does not include the curl utility and must be installed by the script by using the apk tool.

The script's curl command cannot reference the profile-app container using the localhost domain name as it is not defined for this environment. Instead, GitLab defines a domain name derived from the base image's name (docker from docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20). We use the grep Linux utility to look for a substring or pattern in the response from curl's HTTP request - 'User profile is the header in profile-app's home page

Trigger the execution of the pipeline as follows:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Pipeline job to perform a basic test of app."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In the Gitlab browser tab, check the pipeline runs successfully. Examine the log of the basic-test job as follows:

+ Click the tick mark of the test stage of the current pipeline execution.
+ Select the basic-test job.
+ Scroll down to the end of the log. It should look similar to the following:

~~~
$ docker logs profile-app
mongodb://admin:secret@mongoDB:27017
Server script
Server running at 3000
$ curl http://docker:3000 | grep 'User profile'
