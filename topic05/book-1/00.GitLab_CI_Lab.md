## Continuous Integration (CI).

In this lab, we delve into the crucial role of continuous integration (CI) in an application's development process using the GitLab CI service. We focus on creating and executing a CI pipeline that automates build, packaging, and testing tasks for a multi-container application. The CI platform we use is the publicly hosted GitLab service.
