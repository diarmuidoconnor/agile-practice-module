## Agile Software Practice - Assignment 1.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your knowledge of the Docker platform by containerizing the multi-container application described below. 

__Completion date:__ 05/11/2024.

__Weighting:__ 20%.

__Deliverables:__

1. A text file (assignment1.txt) containing:
   + The URL of your GitHub repository. 
   + The URL of the YouTube video demonstrating the startup and testing of the API. 
   
Notes:
+ The repo README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate. A template will be provided later.
+ Your repo's Git log must have a clear, understandable and coherent history of the work on this assignment. The commit message must summarize the work performed (What task were you working on?) at each stage.


### App description.

The app's architecture is illustrated below![][arch]

![][arch]

The Movies API returns information about movies stored in a MongoDB database. A Redis server is used to cache responses from the API and rate-limit requests to it; only requests to the 'get all movies' endpoint are rate-limited.  The Mongo Express web app is used to administer the Mongo database. The application uses the following images:

+ doconnor/movies-api:1.0
+ mongo:8.0-rc
+ redis:alpine
+ mongo-express:1.0-20-alpine3.19

The environment variables required by the movies-api image are:

+ MONGODB_URI: The URL of the MongoDB server, i.e. mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@domain-name:27017.
+ REDIS_URI: The URL of the Redis server, i.e. redis://domain-name.
+ ENABLE_WRITING_HANDLERS: Set to 'false'.

The environment variables for the MongoDB and Mongo Express images are as practised in the labs. The Redis image does not require variables.

The following container isolation requirements should be satisfied:

+ The Express web app should not be accessible from the Redis or the Movies API containers.
+ The MongoDB container should not be accessible from the Redis container. 

During development, the entire stack should be deployed and the database should be seeded. However, there should be no seeding in a production environment, and the Express web app should not be deployed.

__You are required__ to write the Docker Compose file to create the runtime environment for the application.

### Grading Spectrum.

__Good (40-50%):__ Application stack is partially integrated.

__Excellent (50-70%):__ Stack is fully integrated. Container isolation requirements.

__Excellent (70-85%):__ Database seeding.

__Independent Learning (85%+):__ Development and Production stack options.

### Start Up.

Pull the movies API image as follows:

~~~bash
$ docker pull doconnor/movies-api:1.0
~~~

Download [this archive][start], and import it into VS Code. __It must be used as your assignment folder.__
