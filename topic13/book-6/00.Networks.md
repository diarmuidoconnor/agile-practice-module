## Docker Networking.

Docker leverages networking techniques to enhance its __container isolation__ objective. By isolating a container inside a subnetwork, it is prevented from reaching or being contacted by other containers that should not be allowed. In this lab, we will introduce a subset of Docker's network types, in particular the bridge driver, and demonstrate some standard techniques to simplify working with containers, including DNS name resolution and port forwarding.
