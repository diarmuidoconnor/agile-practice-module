## Building Docker Images.

So far, we have been using public images in our containers. In this lab, we want to create custom Docker images, run them as part of a multi-container application, and publish them in a registry so others can access them.

### Prerequisites.

To complete this lab, you will need an account with the Docker Hub service.When creating it:
1. Use your SETU email address.
1. Choose a username that includes your name, e.g. Diarmuid O Connor --> Suitable Username = doconnor, diaoconnor, doconnor24, etc. For NUIST students use the name that appears on your SETU regictration, e.g. Yiming Qian --> yqian, yimqian, yqian02 etc

An account can be created [here][hub].
