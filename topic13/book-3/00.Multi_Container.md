## Multi-Container applications.

In this lab, we will assemble multi-container applications. Docker create networks to facilitate communication between containers, if this is required. Containers reference each other using IP addresses (default) or by container names. We will manually set up the architecture, but a later lab will illustrate how to automate the task. Two sample application will be used as case studies, both with similar architecture but different technology stacks. The architectures are comprised of:

1. A Node/Express frontend app.
1. A database server.
1. A web-based database administration tool.

One application uses a MongoDB database server, while the other uses Postgres for its database.
