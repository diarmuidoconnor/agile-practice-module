## Building Docker Images.

So far, we have been using public images in our containers. In this lab, we want to create custom Docker images, run them as part of a multi-container application, and publish them in a registry so others can access them.

### Prerequisites.

To complete this lab, you will need an account with the [Docker Hub][hub] service.
