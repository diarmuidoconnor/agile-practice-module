## Adding a new method.

Suppose a new method with the following specification is required:

------------------------------------
__checkReorder()__ - The method searches the catalogue for products whose quantity in stock is less than or equal to their reorder level. It returns an object structure as follows:
~~~js
  { 
    type: "Reorder", 
    productIds: [. . . qualifying product ids . . . ] 
  }
~~~
The productIds array will be empty when nothing needs reordering. No change happens to the catalogue's product list.

---------------------------------

Based on this specification, we should consider the following test cases:

1. (Normal) Some products in the catalogue need reordering.
1. (Normal) Currently, no product needs to be reordered.
1. (Exceptional/Boundary) At least one product is on the boundary of its reorder state (quantity in stock == reorder level)
1. (Exceptional/Boundary) The catalogue's product list is empty.

Below is an implementation of the method; add it to `src/catalogue.js`:
~~~js
  checkReorders() {
    const result = { type: "Reorder", productIds: [] };
    this.products.forEach( (p) => {
      if (p.quantityInStock <= p.reorderLevel) {
        result.productIds.push(p.id);
      }
    });
    return result;
  }
~~~
Add a new describe block to `test/catalogue-test.js`, as shown below: 
~~~js
describe("Catalogue", () => {
  . . . . as before . . . .
  describe("removeProductById", () => {
     . . . . as before . . . .
  });
  describe("checkReorder", () => {
    it("should return an empty array when no products need reordering", function () {
      const result = cat.checkReorders();
      expect(result.productIds).to.be.empty;
    });
    it("should report products that satisfy the reorder criteria", function () {
      cat.addProduct(new Product("B123", "Product 4", 10, 20, 10.0));
      cat.addProduct(new Product("B124", "Product 5", 10, 30, 10.0));
      const result = cat.checkReorders();
      expect(result.productIds).to.have.lengthOf(2);
      expect(result.productIds).to.have.members(["B123", "B124"]);
    });
    it("should include products just on their reorder level", function () {
      cat.addProduct(new Product("B125", "Product 6", 10, 10, 10.0));
      const result = cat.checkReorders();
      // TO BE COMPLETED
    });
    it("should handle the empty catalogue case", function () {
       // TO BE COMPLETED
     });
  });
});
~~~
The last two test cases above are incomplete - ignore them for the moment.

Some points to note about the implemented test cases:

1. Note how expressive the expect statements can be, e.g. expect(result).to.be.empty, expect(.. array..).to.have.members([....]).
1. In the second test case, we are adding some products that satisfy the reorder criteria.

Run the tests to confirm they all pass:
~~~
$ npm run test
~~~

__You are required__ to complete the last two test cases. [See next page for solution.]

When completed, update the git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Check reorders fully implemented and tested."
~~~
