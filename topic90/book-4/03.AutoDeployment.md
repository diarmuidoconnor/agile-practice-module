## CI/CD pipeline.

Whenever the 2048 game app is changed, we want the update deployed to our EC2 instance __automatically__. This is the purpose of the CD aspect of a CI/CD process.

In VS Code, add a new file to the Game project called `.gitlab-ci.yml` and initialize it as follows:
~~~yaml
default:
    image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
    services:
    - name: docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20

variables:
  APP_NAME: 2048game
  DOCKER_TAG: ${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
  DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: 'yourUsername'   # REPLACE THIS!

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-and-publish::
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME} .
    - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
    - docker tag  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME} 
                 ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG} 
    - docker push ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG}
    - |
      if [ -n "$CI_COMMIT_TAG" ]; then
         docker tag  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_TAG} 
         docker push  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_TAG} 
      fi

base test:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - docker pull  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG}  
  script: 
    - docker run -d --name ${APP_NAME}  -p 80:80 
         ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG} 
    - apk add curl
    - docker ps
    - docker logs ${APP_NAME}
    - curl http://docker:80 | grep '2048'
~~~
Make sure to set the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME variable to your username. The jobs in this pipeline are similar to those in last week's CI lab, but you should still study and understand them. Please note that the base-test job will perform the desiired task, but is __not__ written in the most efficient way. Can you improve it?

In a browser tab, go to this project in your Gitlab account, declare an environment variable (Settings --> CI/CD --> Variables --> CI/CD variables) called DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN and set it to your token value.

In VS Code, commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Basic CI pipeline."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In Gitlab, check that the pipeline executed successfully.

### The Deploy pipeline stage.

In VS Code, make the following changes to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

+ Add a new job at the end.
~~~yaml
deploy-to-ec2:
  stage: deploy
  image:
    name: alpine
  before_script:
     - apk add openssh-client
     - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
     - echo "${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add -
     - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
     - chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  script:
     - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${SSH_USER}@${SSH_HOST}
         "docker rm -f ${APP_NAME} && 
          docker run -itd --name ${APP_NAME} -p80:80 
             ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG}"
~~~

In GitLab, we must add several environment variables to the pipeline. Make sure each variable has the following configuration:

1. Visibility set to Visible.
1. Both Flags are disabled.

The variable names and values are as follows:
[Make sure not to include any extra spaces at the beginning or end of a variable value.]
1. SSH_HOST - set to the public IP address of the EC2 instance, e.g. 3.250.97.134.
1. SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - set to the entire content of `cicdpair.pem` (which you downloaded earlier). 
1. SSH_USER_FOR_EC2_STAGING - set to ec2-user.

Returning to VS Code, in `index.html`, change the title tag from:
~~~html
  <title>2048</title>
~~~
to 
~~~html
  <title>2048 Game</title>
~~~
Commit the changes
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added Deploy job to the pipeline."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In Gitlab, check that the three pipeline stages have completed successfully. Refresh the browser tab that's displaying the game. Notice that the tab label has changed to' 2048 Game', which indicates that the pipeline redeployed the app to EC2.
