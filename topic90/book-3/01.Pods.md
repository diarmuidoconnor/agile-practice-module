## Pod Basics.

In `k8s-basics`, create a file named `nginx-pod.yaml`:
~~~
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: nginx-pod1
   labels:
      team: integration
      app: todo
spec:  
  serviceAccountName: bsc-ssd-y4-2025-sa
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
~~~
The manifest declares a single-container pod that runs the NGINX web server. Ccreate the pod resource in the cluster:
~~~
$ oc apply -f nginx-pod.yaml 
~~~
Check the pod deployed successfully:
~~~
$ oc get pods -o wide            
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE      NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod1   1/1     Running   0          3m29s   10.129.2.57   worker2   <none>           <none>
~~~
Use port-forwarding to enable a web client to communicate with the web server:
~~~
$ oc port-forward nginx-pod1  3006:80                 
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3005 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:3005 -> 80
~~~
Open a browser tab at http://localhost:3006/


In VS Code, open a second integrated terminal and check the log output from the pod's container:
~~~
❯ oc logs nginx-pod1 
~~~
The last entry in the response should confirm it received the browser request, i.e. GET / HTTP/1.1.

We can open a terminal session inside the container:
~~~
$ oc exec -it nginx-pod1  -- /bin/sh
~~~
At the container prompt, type the following command sequence:
~~~
ls
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
ls
cat index.html     
echo "<b>I added a new line ....</b>" >> index.html 
~~~
We added a new line to the end of the default NGINX home page. Assuming the port-forwarding to the container is still active, refresh the browser to confirm the page change. 

Interrupt the port-forwarding command.

Commit the work so far:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Creating simple single-container pod."
~~~

Switch to the other terminal session and stop the port-forwarding.

### ReplicaSets.
Creating multiple copies of a pod, called replica sets, distributed across the worker nodes of a cluster, improves app availability. 

Create a new file called `httpd-replica.yaml`:
~~~
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: httpd-replica
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  template:
    metadata:
      name: httpd-pod
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: bsc-ssd-y4-2025-sa
      containers:
      - name: httpd-pod
        image: httpd:latest
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
~~~
This manifest declares a replicaset of two single-container pods running the Apache Web Server (httpd image). Create the resources:
~~~
$ oc apply -f httpd-replica.yaml
$ oc get rs        (rs = replicaset )  
$ oc get po        (po = pods )              
~~~
Test one of the pods with port forwarding:
~~~
$ oc port-forward httpd-replica-bkxg7  3000:80    (Your pod name will be different)
~~~
Find the IP addresses of all your pods:
~~~
$ oc get pods -o wide            
~~~
Because all pods are in the same cluster, they can communicate using IP addresses, even though they may be on different nodes. Try the following sequence:
~~~
$ oc exec -it httpd-replica-bkxg7  -- /bin/sh    (Use your first HTTPD pod name)
# apt-get -y update            (These commands are executed inside the container)
# apt-get -y install curl     
#
# curl 10.130.0.124:80          (Use the IP address of your second HTTPD pod)
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
#
# curl 10.129.2.66:80           (Use the IP address of your NGINX pod)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
. . . . NGINX home page . . . .
</html>
# exit
~~~

Commit the work so far:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Creating simple replicaset."
~~~

__Cleanup:__ Delete the current pods:
~~~
$ oc delete pod nginx-pod1
$ oc delete -f httpd-replica.yaml     (Delete every resource created by a manifest)
~~~

### Exercise.

The Apache Web servers (httpd) hosted by our replica set return a static web page with the text:

__It works__

__You are required__ to perform the necessary steps so that the response includes the IP address of the pod, for example:

__It works__

__Hello world from 10.130.0.128__

[Hint: To find the IP address of a Linux-based entity, use the command:
~~~
hostname -i
