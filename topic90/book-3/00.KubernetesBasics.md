## Introduction to OCP/Kubernetes.

The Red Hat OpenShift® Container Platform (OCP) is an enterprise-standard Kubernetes platform. The [Walton Institute][walton] has made a Kubernetes cluster running on OCP available to SETU Waterford studentsfor experimentation. In this lab, we will deploy manifests for the fundamental Kubernetes resources, and use the OCP CLI (oc) to interact with the cluster's API server component.

### Startup.

Create a new folder (anywhere) called `k8s-basics` and import it into VS Code. Add a `.gitignore` file:
~~~
*.log
~~~
Create a local Git repository in the folder, and make the first commit to the repo.

Earlier in the semester you downloaded the OCP CLI. Login to your cluster account:
 
~~~
$ oc login https://api.ocp-setu.waltoninstitute.ie:6443 --username=<yourUserName>
~~~
Verify you are logged into the cluster:
~~~bash
$ oc whoami
~~~
