# Unit testing - Mocha.

This lab demonstrates automated unit testing in Javascript using the Mocha framework and Chai library. On completion, you should have a clear understanding of how to structure unit test code and design appropriate test cases for a function or class method specification. 

The principles of testing are covered, including:

+ Test scenarios - Test design should consider the three runtime scenario: normal, exceptional (if relevant) and error (if applicable).
+ Test case isolation.
+ Target object state - Some methods modify the target object's state. The tests should prove this behaviour, in addition to ensuring the method response value is correct.

This lab demonstrates the test-driven development (TDD) methodology for one method specification. 

## Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start] and import it into VS Code, and type the command:
~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~
In the project itself, the `src` (source) folder contains the declaration of two classes, __Catalogue__ and __Product__. The Product is a simple data type and does not require testing. Because the Catalogue has more state and behaviour (methods); it is the *test target* for this lab. Currently, Catalogue has two methods; we will add more during the lab. 

The `test` folder will contain the testing code that we will develop in this lab.
